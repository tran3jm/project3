Met Expectations: We met most expectations from the project description listed. 
We used XAMPP to create a local web server. We have multiple external .js files. 
We have a dynamic greeting and we have buttons and menus that implement fadeToggle 
and slideToggle respectively. We created a login function and allowed the used to 
log in and create and account. It is in a database, but the user information is only 
reflected after the create their account. Once they create, then they can log in and
see user info. RegEx is also used in the register page. We have javascript files with 
loops, arrays, variables with local and global scope, objects and conditional statements.

Unmet Expectations:  The Dynamic greeting is a bit shoved in, but it works and we hope to 
find a better way to integrate it. We were able to figure out the database and how to create new users,
 have an admin user, and display their information once they logged in. However, we could not figure out 
 in time how to change the user passwords so we would just delete the user form the data base, as stated 
 as an option in the specs. This can be fleshed out more, but we did not have enough time to finish.
Above and Beyond: We believe our aesthetic is very good and clean. We also have a very clean login page 
and we have an automatic carousel for menu items and a manual carousel to scroll through locations.
Hour Count: we believe we contributed around 30 hours total to the project.
Grade Anticipated:  We anticipate a grade around A to B+ range.
